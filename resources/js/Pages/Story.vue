          In the 1970s, Tejnesh (Emmodish) Benti was the head researcher in the
          Experimental Kitchen department of the Ethiopian Nutrition Institute.
          Her team’s lab work refined traditional recipes, tweaking ingredients
          and cooking practices to naturally enhance the nutritional value of
          Ethiopian staple foods. The Institute used these findings as
          educational resources for its public initiatives, including maternal
          health and school feeding programs. Emmodish took her expertise into
          her own kitchen when the Institute was dissolved in the early 1990s.
          This was when her passion for Ethiopian cuisine really blossomed. She
          created her own spice blends that she sifted into staple dishes,
          making her already nutritiously rich meals sing with flavor.

          Before she founded Arki, Emmodish began to notice that as Addis
          Ababa’s population grew, fewer and fewer people had the open air and
          space necessary to prepare traditional flours & spice blends in their
          own homes. Increasingly, she would get requests from extended family
          to prepare their year’s provision of berbere and shiro. Her recipes
          had always been popular but it was then that demand for them grew. The
          idea for Arki sparked then and developed steadily, along with
          Emmodish’s excitement that she could share her four decades in
          nutrition science and original recipes with a wider audience. It was
          in this way that Emmodish founded Arki as a labor of love, her
          offering to everyone who wants to cook clean and eat meals that sing
          with flavor.
